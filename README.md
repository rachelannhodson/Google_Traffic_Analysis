# Google_Traffic_Analysis

This is a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) workspace, similar to Jupyter Lab Notebook. This file utilizes Python to analyze and forecast website search traffic as well as stock closing prices and daily revenue. A data analyst may use pandas to read any given `.csv` files, then use the writen code to determine their company's outlook.

## Technologies

Inside the Google Colab file, there are four populated imports:

```python
!pip install pystan
!pip install prophet
!pip install hvplot
!pip install holoviews
```

These imports will run through the cloud and do not need to be installed on your local machine.

The following libraries do need to be installed on your local machine:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.13/visualization.html)

## Installation Guide

If you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) downloaded, then pandas and matplotlib will be part of your package. You can check that they're ready to use by typing the following in your CLI terminal:

```python
conda list pandas
conda list matplotlib
```

## Usage

Click here to be redirected to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) Workspace. Upload the `forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb` file.

Be sure to download your `.csv` files to your local machine as you will need to upload them manually to the Google Colab workspace. 

You can then use the code written in the file to analyze your `.csv` files. You can use the prophet library to predict and forecast future outcomes for your company's online search trends, stock prices, and gross revenue.
